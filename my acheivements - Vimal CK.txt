Many developers I know are interested to use productivity tools to improve their work and often 
prefer to use keyboard shortcuts than mouse. I have developed an extension called "Sempu" to help 
developers to view the available shortcuts. Extension has a voice recogination feature
to execute the commands.

I am doing my academic research on "Digitization of Intangible Cultural Heritage" using 
Photogrammetry, Reflectence Transmission Imaging Process, and AI. I have done a PoC on digitizing
cultural artefacts like 3D objects, audio and videos using Photogrammetry, RTI and AI. I am considering
this as one of my significant acheivement as it contributes to preserving our cultural heritage for the 
upcoming generation. It can also help research students, archivists and others in their work.


I am also an active member of Stackoverflow community to help other developers as much as I can.
